"""The liveness probe, and what it deliberately does not know about.

`/health` answers for the deploy: is this process up and serving. Nothing else belongs
in it, and the pressure to add things is constant -- a third-party credential, a queue
depth, a disk. Each addition makes the probe red for something the operator cannot fix
from the deploy layer, and an operator who learns that red does not mean "roll back"
learns to ignore red.
