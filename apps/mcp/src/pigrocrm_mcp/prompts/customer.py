"""§10's fourth prompt, and the only one that embeds a resource.

It is the only one because it is the only one whose resource **already exists**:
`customer://{id}`, from slice 1 §8.4. A resource block needs a URI, and there is no URI for
"the commercial dashboard for March" that would not be a new resource invented in order to
have one -- which §11.1 explicitly declines.

**The text block carries only what the card does not.** `render_customer` already renders
the fiscal identity, the contacts, the deals and the timeline, and an `EmbeddedResource`
must carry the resource's text -- `TextResourceContents.text` is required by the protocol
types, so the card is in the message either way. Repeating the deal list beside it would
double the section that costs the most and add nothing a reader could not already see, which
is exactly the tax §10 is about. What the card has no notion of is money owed, so that is
what the text block is: the unpaid invoices, and the posture.
