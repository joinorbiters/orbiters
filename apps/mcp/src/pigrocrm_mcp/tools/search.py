"""The thin half. Everything that matters happened in `SearchService`.

Shaped exactly like `tools/customers.py`: resolve the service on the context's session, call
it, `model_dump(mode="json")`.

What keeps the score out of an agent's context as `0.6000000238418579` is
`SearchHit.punteggio` being a `Decimal` and not a `float` -- measured, not assumed:
swapping `mode="json"` for the default here leaves every assertion in
`apps/mcp/tests/test_mcp_search.py` green, because the SDK's own encoder renders a
`Decimal` and a `UUID` as strings anyway. `mode="json"` stays because every other tool
module in this package spells it, and one module that dumps in a different mode is a
difference a reader has to stop and account for; it is consistency, not the safeguard.
The safeguard is the schema type, and the test that would catch its loss says so.
