"""The three tools that actually read the titolare's Drive, and the two switches they
live behind.

`tools/drive.py`'s `describe_drive_account` diagnoses the CRM's own record of a
credential: no quota, no consent exercised, so it is registered wherever Google is
configured. These three are the opposite kind of thing. `list_drive_files`,
`read_drive_file` and `import_drive_file` spend the titolare's Drive quota under the
titolare's OAuth consent, and the last of them writes a document row -- exactly the
reasoning that already puts `discover_gmail_correspondents` in `tools/privileged.py`.
So they live in `tools/drive_privileged.py`, appear only behind **both**
`mcp_full_access` and a configured Google client, and are absent -- not broken --
otherwise.

What this file proves, beyond existence:

  * **No search.** Every parameter of all three is an id held to `drive/query.py`'s own
    strict pattern, a closed enum, or a UUID. The single free-text string on the whole
    surface is `import_drive_file`'s `titolo`, which is `SafeStr`-bounded by
    `DocumentCreate` and reaches `documents.titolo` and nothing else. A `nome` or
    `filtro` parameter would be spec 9C §4.2's forbidden search with better manners,
    and `test_no_drive_tool_takes_a_free_text_string_except_the_title` is what makes
    that a test instead of a comment.
  * **Every listing is scoped to a folder.** The fake transport records what Google was
    actually asked, and each `files.list` this file provokes carries `'<id>' in
    parents`.
  * **Nothing is written to Drive.** `import_drive_file` copies bytes into the CRM; it
    does not move, rename or delete the original. Asserted on the fake's own request
    log, which is the only place a stray `PATCH` or `DELETE` would show up.
  * **A missing Drive is guidance, not a stack trace.** An installation that opened the
    switch but never connected Drive gets the sentence naming «Impostazioni → Drive»,
    because an agent that cannot read that will retry a call that can never succeed.
