"""The MCP surface of slice 5B, and the shape of its asymmetry.

An agent that reads a mailbox is a different proposition from one that creates a
customer, and an agent that *fetches* from a mailbox is a different proposition again.
This file asserts where the line was drawn:

**Granted, reading.** What is already in the CRM -- the stored mirror in
`gmail_messages`, the state of the credential, and the list of invoices worth chasing.
None of them makes a Google call, spends anybody's Gmail quota, or exercises anybody's
consent.

**Granted, writing: `draft_email`, and nothing else.** A draft is inert -- a row in this
CRM that no tool on this surface can send -- and the half that is missing is a person
reading the text before it leaves. That is the design, not a gap: the indefensible
pairing would be the inverse, a surface that could send but not draft.

**Refused, structurally.** Fetching (`sync`, `backfill`), connecting, disconnecting,
changing what the CRM keeps, preparing a payment reminder, and sending. None of them is a
permission check inside a registered tool, because a PAT inherits its owner's full role
and never expires (residuo R10): the only mechanism that holds is that the tool does not
exist. The durable list lives in `test_mcp_invoice_ban.py`, which owns the structural
bans; what is asserted here is the positive half -- exactly five tools, and no sixth,
computed as the difference between the configured and the unconfigured server so that no
tool can hide behind a name the filter does not match.

The proof that the read tools never reach Google is the repository-root socket guard:
it fails any test that opens one, so a read tool that grew a fetch would fail this file
rather than pass it quietly.
