"""Criterion 11. Twenty simultaneous `log_time` calls against real Postgres produce
twenty rows and twenty activities with no session error. It is residual R1 closed, and
it is the condition on which this tool exists at all -- Task 4A-1 is what makes it
pass, and this is the test that proves the fix reached the tool rather than only the
provider.

Seeds its own deal and user through a plain, explicitly committed session against
`mcp_engine` -- not through the `seeded_deal_id`/`seeded_user_id` fixtures (which ride
on `mcp_session`'s per-test, rolled-back savepoint transaction, exactly the
"mcp_session savepoint fixture" `test_session_scope.py`'s own module docstring says
cannot express independent connections). Twenty threads each open their own connection
via `ScopedSessionProvider`; none of them would ever see a deal or a user that only
exists inside a transaction nobody has committed.
