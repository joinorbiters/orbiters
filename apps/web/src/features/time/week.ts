/**
 * The week grid's arithmetic, kept pure so it can be proven with no React and no
 * network.
 *
 * Every date here is built from and read as **local** year/month/day parts, through
 * `lib/dates.ts` rather than through a private copy: `toISOString()` is what moved a
 * 31 March 23:30 CEST entry into April and therefore into the wrong monthly export --
 * the file attached to an invoice -- and `new Date("2026-03-10")` parses as UTC midnight
 * and renders as 9 March anywhere behind UTC. Five copies of those four lines had grown
 * across this codebase before they were consolidated; this module adds no sixth.
 *
 * Hour totals are summed in integer hundredths through `lib/decimal.ts`. This is the
 * only arithmetic the browser is allowed to do in this slice, and only for hours: every
 * economic figure arrives from the API already summed (§6), and `no-float-money.test.ts`
 * fails the build if any module adds one.
