"""Sanitizes an activity payload instead of validating it.

An audit entry must never be able to fail the operation it is auditing: recording,
say, an inbound email's subject line must not stop that email from being linked to
its deal just because the subject contained an odd character. `sanitize_payload`
therefore never raises. Applied recursively to every `dict` and `list` value it finds:

  - non-finite floats (`nan`, `inf`, `-inf`) become their textual name (`"NaN"`,
    `"Infinity"`, `"-Infinity"`). Postgres JSONB rejects them outright; keeping a
    readable string loses less information than the alternative (letting the whole
    write fail) or silently dropping the key.
  - NUL bytes are stripped from strings. Postgres text storage cannot hold one at all.
  - strings longer than `MAX_STRING_LENGTH` are truncated with a trailing "…" -- a
    generous limit that only bites on genuinely oversized input, not a real payload.
  - nesting deeper than `MAX_DEPTH` is replaced with a placeholder string, which stops
    both unbounded recursion and unboundedly large stored documents.
  - `UUID`, `datetime` and `date` become their canonical text form. JSONB serialization
    goes through `json.dumps`, which has no encoder for any of the three: passing one
    raises `TypeError` at `flush()` and takes down the operation being audited, which
    is exactly what this module exists to prevent. They are converted rather than
    dropped because an audit payload's whole job is to name *which* row and *when* --
    the configuration audit entries (`auth`, `fields`, `pipeline`) carry both.

This is the same class of defect the custom-field validator closes (see
`pigrocrm.core.fields.validator`): untrusted data reaching a strict storage layer with
no controlled failure path. The remedy here is deliberately different: the field
validator *rejects*, because a user is actively choosing a value and can be told to fix
it. Nothing here is shown to a human to correct -- sanitizing and moving on is the only
option that does not fail the write this payload is merely riding along with.
