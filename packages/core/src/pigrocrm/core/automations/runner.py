"""The two automations of spec §9, running inside their trigger's transaction.

**Never commits.** `DocumentService.set_offer_state` owns the transaction, and that is the
whole answer to "what happens if an automation fails halfway": there is no halfway. Either
the offer is accepted and the deal is moved, or neither is true.

**Never authorises.** `set_offer_state` already called `actor.require_write`, so a
`readonly` actor never gets here. The runner does not re-check and does not elevate: if it
could elevate, accepting an offer would become a way to write to a deal the actor could not
otherwise touch.

**Never guesses a stage.** By `code`, then by `tipo` where a `tipo` can identify one
(A1 only), then it declines and records why. Never by name -- a name is renamable, and
matching on one is precisely what `pipeline_stages.code` and `tipo` exist to prevent
(slice 1 §5.4, residuo R11).

**Absorbs a declared list and nothing else.** The four `AutomationSkipReason` values are
recorded and the trigger continues. Every other exception propagates and rolls everything
back: a database that cannot write is not an automation that did not fire, and it is the
one case where the user should not see their offer accepted. There is therefore no `except`
anywhere in this file, and `test_no_exception_handler_swallows_anything_in_the_runner`
keeps it that way -- a broad handler here would turn a real failure into a silent
non-execution, which is the exact blur §9.3 refuses.

**A triggered run cannot end silently.** Every path from a recognised transition returns an
`AutomationOutcome`, and that dataclass refuses to exist with neither a move nor a reason:
a fifth, unnamed way of declining is unrepresentable rather than merely untested. The one
thing that ends without an outcome is a transition that was never a trigger, or an offer
with no live deal behind it -- checked before any rule is selected, so no rule ever
"declines" for a reason that is not one of the four.

No execution-log table (§9.4). Idempotence is inherited from three properties already in
the tree: the trigger is unrepeatable by construction (`OFFER_TRANSITIONS` gives
`"accettata": frozenset()`, so `inviata -> accettata` happens at most once per document);
the effect is a state rather than an increment, so a repeat is a recorded no-op; and
atomicity with the trigger means "fired but not recorded" does not exist.
