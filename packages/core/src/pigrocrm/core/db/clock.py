"""The project's only clock.

Nothing anywhere in `packages/core`, `apps/api` or `apps/mcp` may call `date.today()` or
`datetime.now(UTC).date()` to obtain a calendar day. Both answer the *UTC* day (or, for
`date.today()`, the day of whatever timezone the host happens to run in -- `Dockerfile.api`
pins no `TZ`, so the API image runs in UTC), and every `Date` column in this product is a
day in the emitter's zone: at 00:30 on 1 April in Rome it is still 31 March in UTC, so a
deal won just after midnight would land in the previous month's conversion rate, and an
invoice issued on 31 December at 23:30 CET would land in the previous fiscal year -- the
defect slice 3 §6.2 names by name. `packages/core/tests/test_clock.py` enforces that ban
with an AST scan over all three source trees, because commit 875a1f9 had to fix three
sites that were written after the rule was already documented.

`datetime.now(UTC)` for a *timestamp* is still correct and still required: `created_at`,
`updated_at`, `deleted_at` and `occurred_at` are instants, and an instant has no zone
problem. This module is about the other kind of column.

`_now` is a module-level function rather than an inline call so a test can freeze it
without patching the standard library. It is the single freeze point for the whole
product: `pigrocrm.core.clock.oggi_in_italia()` -- which predates this module and has
eight fiscal callers -- is now a thin alias over `today_local()`, so freezing `_now`
freezes both. That delegation is the point of the exercise. Two functions each doing
their own `datetime.now(...).date()` would be two clocks, and two clocks in one product
is a bug that surfaces on 31 December.

    open a new week, and the six days just worked would drop off the chart on the one day
    somebody is most likely to be catching up on them.

    `isoweekday()` returns 1 for Monday through 7 for Sunday, so the offset back to Monday
    is `isoweekday() - 1` -- zero on a Monday, six on a Sunday. `weekday()` would do as
    well and is off by one from the name of the standard; the ISO spelling is the one whose
    numbering can be checked against a calendar without running it.

    Arithmetic on `date` and not on `datetime`, deliberately: the week containing the
    March DST transition is 167 hours long and still seven days, and any duration-based
    derivation loses its last day once a year. It is also why this lives here rather than
    in `core/dashboard/`, which may contain no arithmetic at all (spec §3).
