"""The Drive credential's own refusals.

`gmail/errors.py` exists because retrying an `invalid_grant` is a bug, and its types
keep that distinction alive from the socket to the user. This module exists for the
adjacent reason: the *sentence* has to survive the same trip.

One Google OAuth client authenticates both credentials, so the Gmail side's
`CredentialRevoked` and `ConsentExpired` are the exceptions a Drive code path naturally
ends up raising. They read «ricollega la casella da Impostazioni → Gmail» under the
entity `google_account`, and that text reaches the RFC 9457 problem document and the
MCP guidance message verbatim -- so a revoked *Drive* grant would tell somebody to
reconnect their mailbox. That instruction fixes nothing, and while the reader is
following it the thing that actually broke stays hidden. The `google_account` entity
compounds it: an adapter that routes on the entity would point at the wrong settings
tab.

So these two mirror the Gmail pair exactly -- same base, same terminal-versus-predicted
split, same `details` keys -- and change only the credential named. Nothing here may
hold a token: `details` carries the account id and the address, both of which the
settings page already shows, and the two `__init__` signatures are the only way to
build one, so there is no path by which a caller could attach a secret to it.
