"""Read-only Drive, confined to the folders the titolare pointed at.

Spec 9C names the failure to avoid: reading somebody's Drive. A personal Drive holds
the photos of their children, their rent contract, the folder of another job. So this
module can do exactly three things -- list the children of a folder, fetch the bytes of
one file, turn those bytes into text -- and each of them refuses outright unless the
subject is inside `google_drive_accounts.root_folder_ids`.

**Where the confinement lives.** `drive/query.py` is the first guard: it will not build
a `files.list` that is not scoped to one folder, and it has no search-string builder at
all. That is not enough on its own, because `children_query("<a folder of somebody's
Drive>")` is perfectly well-formed. The second guard is here, and it is
`is_within_roots`: `files.get?fields=id,parents` walked upward until a configured root
is reached, the Drive's own root is reached, or `MAX_ROOT_WALK_LEVELS` levels have been
spent. Outside the roots, `list_children` and the two `read_*` raise `NotFound` --
**before** any `files.list` is issued, so there is no window in which Google was asked
about a folder nobody configured. The third guard is
`tests/test_drive_reader.py`'s closing test, which re-reads every request the fake
transport received across the whole module and checks each listing named a folder of
the hierarchy.

**One sentence for three different situations.** A file that does not exist, a file in
an unconfigured corner of the titolare's own Drive and a file in a stranger's Drive all
answer `NotFound("drive_file", <id>)`, in the same words. Distinguishing them would
answer "is there a file with this id?" for anybody who can reach the tool, which is an
existence oracle over all of Google Drive.

**Two severities for an id, from `query.py`.** Every id a *caller* supplies -- the
`folder_id` of a listing, the `file_id` of a read -- is checked against the strict
pattern before anything happens, and that check is `query.py`'s own rather than a
second regex here: two patterns for one rule is one pattern that will drift. Ids that
came out of Drive's own answers (a child of a listing, a parent of a metadata call)
pass only the builders' laxer check, for the reason that module's docstring gives at
length.

**Nothing here writes.** Not a `files.create`, not a `files.delete`, not an upload:
`storage/gdrive.py` remains the only writer of Drive, on its own credential, and 9D is
what imports a file into a document. A reader that could also write would make "read
these folders" a promise held up by nobody checking.

) -> DriveReader:
    """A reader on this actor's connected Drive account, or the refusal that says why not.

    The order is the point, and there are now four gates in it, each of which must come
    before the next has anything to say:

    1. `action`, when given: the operation the caller is about, checked against
       `AGENT_FORBIDDEN_ACTIONS` before this function touches the database at all. An
       agent credential on an installation that has not opted in is refused here, so it
       never learns whether a Drive is even connected;
    2. `usable`, which holds no transport and therefore *cannot* have called Google, so
       a revoked grant, an expired consent or a missing `drive.readonly` is learnt at
       the ask rather than from a failed Drive call;
    3. the roots, which must not be empty -- see below;
    4. only then the refresh token, unsealed and wrapped in `UserTokens` for a
       `DriveTransport`. The roots come from the row, so a reader cannot be pointed at a
       folder the titolare did not configure.

    `feature` is the name the refusal uses ("la lettura dei documenti da Drive"), so a
    missing scope reads as a feature that is off rather than as a broken credential.

    `action` is the name `AGENT_FORBIDDEN_ACTIONS` lists the operation under -- the MCP
    tool's own name, which is also what a REST route would pass. It is here, at the one
    point every reader of Drive is built from, rather than in each caller: the tool being
    unregistered protects the MCP transport only, and a personal access token is not
    confined to it (see `core/actor.py`, and the commit its comment names). A route that
    composes a reader inherits the ban by passing its action.

    It is *optional* because one existing caller must not pass one:
    `InvoiceService._drive_reader`, whose operation is `import_issued_invoice` -- already
    on the list, and already checked by `import_issued` under that name. Passing it here
    too would check the same ban twice, and passing anything else would check the wrong
    one. `None` therefore means "the caller's own authorization has already run", which
    is a statement a caller makes deliberately rather than a default it inherits by
    forgetting; nothing here can tell those two apart, which is why the three MCP tools
    are tested against a closed agent credential one by one.

    **Empty roots are guidance, not an empty answer.** A connected credential with no
    `root_folder_ids` is a real state -- `DriveRootsUpdate` requires at least one, so
    the only way to have none is never to have configured them -- and it is a
    configuration step, not a fault. Without this the reader would compose happily and
    every operation would answer "not found", or list nothing: an agent would report
    that the titolare's Drive is empty, and the person would go looking for a bug
    instead of opening the settings screen.

    `on_revoked` closes the last gap: a revocation can only be *learned* by a refresh
    that answers `invalid_grant`, which happens deep inside a read. `mark_revoked`
    commits on its own behalf, so the fact outlives the rollback of whatever operation
    discovered it, and then the exception continues.

    The `GoogleTokenClient` is built here and lives as long as the reader. Unlike
    `routers/gmail.py`'s per-process cache, that means one token exchange per reader
    rather than one per hour per process -- the price of `packages/core` not owning a
    process-wide cache, and the same choice `apps/mcp`'s privileged tools already make.
