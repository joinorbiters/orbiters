"""The credential's state, and the two questions that must never be confused.

*Is the credential healthy?* is `status`. *Is this feature available?* is derived from
`scopes_granted` at the point of use. A valid credential that was granted less than was
asked for is healthy; it is the feature that is unavailable. Conflating them is the
contradiction the rest of the OAuth-integration world falls into, and it produces a
"ricollega la casella" prompt for a problem reconnecting does not fix.

Four statuses and four sentences, because each one asks something different of the
person: nothing, wait, re-consent, re-connect. The one thing this module refuses to do
is collapse them into "problema con Gmail" -- that is the Acme defect, which turned a
revoked grant and a dropped packet into the same screen and therefore the same wrong
reaction.

`/health` deliberately does **not** change when any of this goes wrong. A broken Gmail
credential is not a broken deploy, and teaching the operator that the probe goes red for
things they cannot fix from the deploy layer teaches them to ignore the probe.

One new `activities` kind lives here: `gmail.impostazioni_modificate`, beyond the nine
the design lists. Turning the body store off changes what the CRM will remember of
somebody's correspondence, which is worth a trace; `activities.kind` is open by project
(slice 1 §5.8), so a new one costs no migration.
