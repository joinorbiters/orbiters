class GoogleAccount(Base, PrimaryKeyMixin, TimestampMixin):
    """One connected mailbox, per CRM user.

    `status` has four values, and every distinction between them is load-bearing
    because each calls for something different from the person:

    * `active` -- nothing to do.
    * `expired` is what we *predicted*: the consent window has passed with no successful
      refresh since. A warning to show early.
    * `revoked` is what Google *told us* (`invalid_grant`). A fact to record.
    * `disconnected` is what the *user* did, from Impostazioni → Gmail.

    The last one used to share `revoked`'s value, told apart only by `disconnected_at`
    being non-null. That was a real defect and not a tidiness point: every screen and
    every gate reading `status` told somebody who had just unhooked their own mailbox
    that Google had revoked their consent, and offered to reconnect what they had
    deliberately disconnected. Two events, two states -- the same argument that keeps
    `expired` and `revoked` apart, and a view is not the place to reconstruct it from a
    nullable timestamp.

    `disconnected_at` stays, because *when* is still worth knowing; it is no longer what
    carries the meaning.

    `scopes_granted` deliberately does not feed `status`. Capability is derived from it
    at the point of use; the health of the credential is `status`. Google may grant a
    subset, and an account with `gmail.send` but not `gmail.readonly` is a healthy
    credential on which sync is unavailable.

    Nothing on this class is safe to print. There is deliberately no `__repr__`:
    SQLAlchemy's declarative base does not add one, so the inherited `object.__repr__`
    prints the class and an address and nothing else, which is the behaviour the two
    `refresh_token_*` columns need from every traceback and every debugger frame.
