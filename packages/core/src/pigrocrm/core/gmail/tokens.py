"""Access tokens: obtained, cached in memory, never stored.

Three things Acme got wrong and this module exists to get right:

1. It discarded `expires_in` and re-exchanged on every call site -- two OAuth
   round-trips to send one invoice email.
2. Its Gmail refresh token fell back to the Drive one (`effectiveGmailRefresh`),
   putting two different capabilities on one credential.
3. It could not tell `invalid_grant` from a transient failure, so a revoked token and
   a flaky network produced the same screen and the same wrong reaction.

Only the refresh token is persisted, and only encrypted (`gmail/crypto.py`). An access
token is valid for an hour; persisting it would add a second secret to protect for no
gain.

Nothing in this module logs, and nothing that leaves it carries a token. Both dataclass
types below mark their token fields `repr=False`: a dataclass has a generated `repr`,
and a generated `repr` prints itself into every traceback that has one of these in a
frame, into `logger.debug("%s", grant)`, and into a pytest failure dump. The cache is
covered by the same rule for the same reason -- a cache is one more place a secret sits.
