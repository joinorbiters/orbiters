"""The single authority on rounding for this project.

Three scales, not two (slice 4 §6.1). Money and every P&L row are 2 places; hours
are 2 places; **rates and internal hourly costs are 6**, because slice 3 makes
`invoice_lines.prezzo_unitario` `Numeric(12,6)` and a rate at two places would
change value the moment hours became an invoice line -- the reconciliation of slice
4B would then fail by cents for a reason nobody could reconstruct.

`ROUND_HALF_UP`, never `ROUND_HALF_EVEN`. Italian fiscal practice, inherited from
slice 3 §6.1, and what the SdI's own arithmetic expects on the invoice line these
hours become. `Decimal.quantize` defaults to the context rounding, which is
`ROUND_HALF_EVEN`; every call here passes the mode explicitly rather than depending
on a context nobody sets.

Lives at the top level of `core`, not inside `timetracking/`, because `analytics/`
needs the identical arithmetic and a second copy is how two totals begin to
disagree.
