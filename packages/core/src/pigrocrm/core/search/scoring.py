r"""Spec §8.5's score, as a SQL expression.

Computed in the database, not in Python, and that is a decision rather than a shortcut:
the tail of a trigram scan on 50 000 rows is thousands of rows, and ranking in Python
would mean fetching all of them to throw almost all away. Ranking in SQL lets
`ORDER BY … LIMIT` discard the tail before it crosses the wire, which is what makes
criterion 3's 300 ms budget reachable. The cost of the decision is that this expression
*is* the formula: §8.5 is pinned by tests against real Postgres rather than by unit tests
over pure functions.

Three details that are easy to get wrong and expensive to rediscover.

**`similarity()` returns `real`.** It is cast to `numeric` the moment it appears. A float
would violate the project's no-float rule for no benefit and would render as
`0.6000000238418579` in JSON, which also breaks criterion 4's byte-identical requirement.
A `real` cast to `numeric` is exact and deterministic for a given input, and the whole
expression comes back as a `Decimal` at the declared scale. (`sqlalchemy.cast` and
`func.cast` compile identically here -- SQLAlchemy special-cases the name -- so the
spelling is a matter of reading, not of behaviour; verified, not assumed.)

**The substring arm is `word_similarity(termine, campo)`, not `similarity(campo, termine)`,
and that is the one place this module departs from §8.5 as written.** The ladder's third
rung is about a term occurring *inside* a field, and `similarity()` does not measure that:
it compares whole strings, so it penalises a field for the text it carries besides the
match. Measured on real Postgres, `similarity('01234567890', '34567')` is 0.2000, which
puts §8.5's own third rung at 0.1200 -- below the 0.20 floor task A8 applies. The plan
promises that exact search in three places (§17, the `search_everything` MCP docstring,
and the "un frammento di partita IVA trova il cliente" end-to-end test), so §8.5's formula,
the floor and the product promise cannot all three be satisfied by `similarity()`.
`word_similarity()` is pg_trgm's own answer to "how well does this term match some extent
of this string": it scores the same pair 0.5000, every literal containment measured on
this corpus lands between 0.5 and 1.0, and every non-containment measured lands at exactly
0. The rest of §8.5 is untouched -- same 0.60 factor, same ceiling below the 0.80 prefix
rung, same weights, same floor -- and the ladder still orders a prefix above a mid-word
match, because the prefix arm is reached first. The same GIN trigram indexes serve both
functions, so task A2's nine indexes are unaffected.

**The prefix arm builds a LIKE pattern, so it escapes.** Without `escape_like`, a term
ending in `_` prefix-matches any character in that position, and the score for
`Rossi_Ingegneria` and `RossiXIngegneria` would be identical. The substring filter has
always escaped; the prefix arm is new here and needs the same treatment. Task A2 measured
that the `ESCAPE` clause costs the trigram indexes nothing -- identical plans node for
node, on all nine columns -- so it stays here exactly as it stands in the four
repositories.

There is no `lower()` around the trigram column anywhere: `similarity()` normalises to
lower case internally (`similarity('Rossi','rossi') = 1`), and wrapping the column would
make the `*_trgm` indexes unusable by the `ILIKE` this module emits (spec §8.2).
