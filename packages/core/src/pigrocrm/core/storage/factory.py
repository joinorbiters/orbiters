    is the only place they are looking.

    refused to come up, or whose first document operation over the API answered 500 --
    somebody who has no map of this project's slices and no way to act on one, and a
    slice number is a fact about when the code was written, which stops being true the
    moment it ships.

    Built here rather than raised in two branches below: the half-configured service
    account and the missing session factory are the same problem to the reader (Drive
    is selected and finished being configured by neither route), and two copies of this
    paragraph would eventually be two different paragraphs.

    never call this, which is what makes swapping backends a configuration change
    rather than a code change (spec 11 criterion 5).

    `session_factory` is what the second Drive route needs and the first does not: the
    titolare's credential and the folder it writes into live in `google_drive_accounts`,
    so that storage has to be able to open a session later, at each operation. It is
    optional because two of the three outcomes here have no use for one -- and because
    an adapter with no database (there is none today, but the parameter should not
    invent one) can still ask for `local`.

    Which of the two Drive routes is chosen is settled by the environment alone, never
    by which one happens to work: naming *either* service-account variable selects the
    service account and makes the other one required, so a half-finished service-account
    setup fails loudly instead of silently falling through to somebody's personal Drive
    credential.

    **When "loudly" is.** This function runs when an adapter builds its storage, and the
    two adapters do that at different moments. `apps/mcp` calls it in `build_server`, at
    start-up, so a misconfiguration there is a process that does not come up. `apps/api`
    calls it from the `get_storage` dependency, which FastAPI resolves at the first
    request that touches a document -- so there the same misconfiguration is a 500 on
    the first upload, generation or download, and the API itself starts fine. Deliberate,
    and not an oversight to be fixed by building it at import time: an installation whose
    Drive is not connected *yet* must be able to reach the screen that connects it (see
    `LazyUserDriveStorage`), and a process that refuses to boot cannot serve that screen.
