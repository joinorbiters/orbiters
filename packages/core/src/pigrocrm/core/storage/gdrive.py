"""Google Drive as a `DocumentStorage`: where a document goes, and how it is found.

The HTTP layer and the credential are not here. They live in `drive/transport.py`
(`DriveTransport` plus a `TokenProvider`), because slice 9 needs the same HTTP client
driven by a *user* OAuth token as well as by today's service account, and only the
credential differs between the two. Neither are the URLs: every one of them is built by
`drive/query.py`, which is the only module in the repository allowed to name a Drive
host at all -- a guard slice 9C needs because reading a person's Drive must be
impossible to construct, not merely discouraged, and a guard worth nothing if this
module keeps its own two hosts in a corner. This module is the part that does not
change: placement, identity, and the four `DocumentStorage` methods.

**Operational requirement, not a detail** -- and one that applies to the service-account
setup specifically: a service account has no Drive storage quota of its own.
`PIGROCRM_GDRIVE_ROOT_FOLDER_ID` must name a folder on a *Shared Drive*, or a folder
explicitly shared with the service account's address, or `files.create` fails with
`storageQuotaExceeded`. Every call below carries `supportsAllDrives=true` for that
reason, and `verify_root_accessible` (called once by `storage_from_settings`, not by
anything in this class automatically) turns a misconfigured root into one refusal that
names it -- at start-up on the MCP adapter, and inside the first request that needs a
document backend on the API -- instead of a `storageQuotaExceeded` on a real upload.

**Placement vs. identity.** The key is a path, and `a/b/c.pdf` is filed under nested
folders `a` then `b` beneath the configured root, with a file `c.pdf` inside -- one
folder per customer, matching how the system this replaces already organised things,
so a person migrating finds their documents where they expect (spec 5).

But Drive does not enforce name-uniqueness among siblings: two concurrent uploads for
a brand-new customer can each fail to see the other's just-created folder and each
create one of the same name under the same parent. From that point on the *tree* is
ambiguous -- a lookup that walks it by name can land on either folder, including one
that does not contain the file being looked for. So the tree is for placement and
human navigation only, never for identity: every file this class writes carries the
full storage key in its `appProperties`, and `get`/`delete` locate it with a
property-filtered query that does not care which folder it ended up in. `_ensure_folder`
still has to cope with the same raciness for *placement* (two `put()`s for a new
customer's first document must not scatter their files across two duplicate folders
forever) by re-querying after a create and adopting one candidate deterministically.
