"""Walk the parsed tree, escaping each value for the context its node recorded.

The output is *compiled Markdown*, not a PDF: Pandoc and Typst are somebody else's
job (`pigrocrm.core.render.pdf`, not built yet). Keeping this module free of I/O is
what lets the adversarial escaping cases be tested as pure string comparisons, with
no container, no subprocess and no PDF to parse.

Two ways to get this specific module wrong that no test of `escaping.py` or
`parser.py` alone can catch, because both of those modules are correct on their own
terms and stay that way even if this one misuses them:

1. Applying the wrong escaper, or applying one twice. `VariableNode.context` is
   decided once, by the parser, from which segment the placeholder was found in --
   this module never re-derives or second-guesses it. Escaping is applied exactly
   once, to the raw formatted value, at `_render_variable`; nothing downstream of
   that call ever touches the string again with an escaper.
2. Escaping at the wrong moment: the *value*, never the assembled output. `#each`
   renders its body once per item and lets `_render_variable` escape each value as
   it lands in its own node, rather than building a row's text first and escaping
   the concatenation afterwards -- the latter would escape literal template markup
   (the author's own `{{`-free prose around the placeholder) right along with the
   customer's data, which is a different, wrong program.
