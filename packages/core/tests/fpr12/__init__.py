"""The official FPR12 schema, loaded with its one remote import resolved locally.

`Schema_VFPR12_v1.2.3.xsd` carries exactly one `xs:import`, pointing at
`http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/REC-xmldsig-core-20020212/xmldsig-core-schema.xsd`. A CI
run has no network, so the import is redirected to the vendored sibling by an lxml
resolver rather than by editing the schema.

Validation goes through `lxml.etree.XMLSchema` rather than the `xmllint --schema` the
spec's success criterion names. Two reasons, both practical: nothing in this repo
installs `libxml2-utils` (`Dockerfile.api` installs Pandoc, Typst and `libpq5`), and
`lxml` is already a dependency because the generator needs it -- so this is the same
libxml2 engine `xmllint` is a thin CLI over, with no new binary in the image.

Version 1.2.3, not the 1.2.1 the spec names: 1.2.3 is the *fattura ordinaria* schema
in force since 2025-04-01 and 1.2.1 is no longer published. The `versione="FPR12"`
attribute is unchanged across 1.2.x, so nothing about the generator differs; proving a
file valid against a superseded rule set would simply prove the wrong thing.
