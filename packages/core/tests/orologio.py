"""One instant at which Italy and the process disagree about what day it is.

`clock.py` exists because `date.today()` reads the *process's* system timezone and this
project does not control that end to end -- `Dockerfile.api` pins no `TZ`, so the API
runs in UTC. A test that only checks "the service called `oggi_in_italia`" proves
nothing about behaviour: it passes just as happily against an implementation that reads
the right clock and then does the wrong thing with it. What proves the rule is holding
is an assertion taken at a moment where the two clocks give *different answers*, so a
regression to `date.today()` changes the observable result and the test goes red.

Italy is ahead of UTC (CET is +01:00, CEST +02:00), so a UTC process is still on
*yesterday* for the first hour of every Italian day. 00:30 in Rome on 1 January 2026 is
23:30 UTC on 31 December 2025: the two clocks disagree about the day, the month and the
year at once, which is the same shape as the the previous system defect `clock.py`'s docstring
describes -- an instant projected into the wrong zone landing a document in the wrong
fiscal year.

`congela` freezes that instant on both sides of the disagreement:

  * `pigrocrm.core.db.clock._now` is frozen, so `today_local()` -- and `oggi_in_italia()`,
    which is now a thin alias over it (slice 6 Task B1) -- answers `OGGI_IN_ITALIA`
    (1 January 2026): the real function, real `ZoneInfo` conversion, only the instant
    supplied.
  * each production module named by the caller gets a `date` whose `today()` answers
    `OGGI_DEL_PROCESSO` (31 December 2025), which is what the standard library would
    genuinely return for that instant on a host running in UTC.

The freeze point moved from `pigrocrm.core.clock`'s own `datetime` to `db.clock._now`
when Task B1 made `db/clock.py` the product's single clock and `oggi_in_italia()` a
delegation to it. There is exactly one place to freeze because there is exactly one
place that reads the wall clock; a helper that had to patch two would be evidence the
consolidation had not actually happened.

Patching a module attribute rather than the whole interpreter is deliberate: it is the
same `monkeypatch.setattr(module, "datetime", ...)` shape `test_auth_tokens` and
`test_refresh_tokens` already use to freeze token issuance, it needs no `TZ`/`tzset`
games that would leak into other tests through the C library, and the per-module `date`
is patched with `raising=False` because a module that has been fixed correctly no longer
imports `date` at all -- the absence of the name is not a reason for the test to error.
