# All three REST timeline routes declare `Query(ge=1, le=200)`; the shared service
# behind both adapters -- and therefore the MCP `get_timeline` tool, which called
# straight into it with a bare `int` parameter -- enforced no bound at all. `-1`
# reaches Postgres as `InvalidRowCountInLimitClause`; `10**9` succeeds where REST
# would refuse the same value outright. Bounding it here, at the one place both
# adapters share, is what makes the MCP tool match REST without the tool itself
# needing its own copy of the rule -- the same pattern `_check_numbers` already
# uses for `probabilita` on `create_deal`'s tool parameter.
