"""The one rule that cannot be recovered later: core must not depend on adapters.

This is an allowlist, not a denylist. packages/core may import:
  - the standard library,
  - itself (the ``pigrocrm`` namespace),
  - whatever packages/core/pyproject.toml actually declares under
    ``[project].dependencies``.

Anything else - an adapter package such as pigrocrm_api or pigrocrm_mcp, a web
framework, a dependency only the adapters declare - fails the test. This means
adding a dependency to apps/api or apps/mcp never requires touching this file,
while importing something into core that core does not declare fails on its
own, without anyone having to remember to update a denylist by hand.

Known, accepted limitation: dynamic imports are only caught when the module
name is a string literal, e.g. ``importlib.import_module("fastapi")`` or
``__import__("fastapi")``. ``importlib.import_module(some_variable)`` cannot be
resolved statically and slips through - see
test_guard_known_limitation_cannot_catch_dynamic_import_via_variable below,
which demonstrates the gap with a real example instead of just asserting it
away in prose.

# --- slice 6's MCP ban, made mechanical --------------------------------------------
#
# Spec §11.1: for every public method of `DashboardService`, `SearchService` and
# `AutomationConfigService` either an MCP tool calls it, or it appears in a declared
# exclusion list -- and for these three services the list must be **exactly**
# `update_automation_config`. Adding a tool for it breaks the build; removing it from the
# list without adding a tool breaks it too.
#
# Two of the three services do not exist until sub-plan 6B. The list is asserted as a
# constant regardless -- it is the *declaration* the spec fixes -- while the coverage half
# inspects only the classes actually importable. Task B15 adds `DashboardService` and
# `AutomationConfigService` to `_audited_services_slice6()` and changes not one character
# of the list.
#
# Slice 4's own `MCP_EXCLUDED`/`_audited_services()` are not in this file yet: that clause
# belongs to task 4A-13, which is not merged. The four shared helpers below are the ones
# slice 4's plan specifies, verbatim, so that task will find them present and add only its
# own list and tests. Neither ordering duplicates a helper.
#
# This is deliberately *not* a second copy of `apps/mcp/tests/test_mcp_surface_coverage.py`,
# which resolves each call's receiver through an AST walk and is strictly stronger. That
# file answers "is every service method reachable"; this one answers the narrower question
# §11.1 asks by name, in the place slice 4 put it -- so a reader looking for the ban finds
# it where the spec says it lives, and so task B15 has the interface its brief names. Where
# the two ever disagree, the AST walk is right and this clause is the one to fix.
