"""**Criterion 7.** The automation is atomic with its trigger.

With an error injected between the automation and the commit, neither thing happened: the
offer is still `inviata` and the deal is still in its old stage, verified by re-reading
both rows on a fresh session. This is the assertion that makes "there is no halfway" a
property rather than a claim, and it needs its own committed rows -- `db_session` holds an
outer transaction open, so a rollback inside it cannot be told apart from the fixture's
own cleanup.

Two mistakes are possible here and they are mirror images. The one slice 5 kept producing
was a `session.rollback()` whose scope was **wider** than its author imagined. The one this
file is built to catch is the inverse: a commit whose scope is **narrower** than its
author imagined -- a `commit()` inside `DealService` or inside the runner that persists the
deal's movement on its own, so that a later failure leaves the deal moved and the offer
still `inviata`. Re-reading two rows after a successful call cannot see that; only failing
the second half, and watching a concurrent observer mid-transaction, can. Hence
`test_an_error_between_the_automation_and_the_commit_undoes_both` and
`test_a_concurrent_reader_sees_neither_half_until_the_commit`, which is a real race on two
connections with barriers because the transactional `db_session` cannot host one.

    The previous test proves a rollback undoes both halves; it cannot prove that the deal's

    inside the runner would publish the deal's new stage — and, with it, the document's
    half-written state — before the trigger had finished, and every assertion made after a
    successful call would still pass.

    `ActivityRepository.add` for the document's own `state_changed` entry, which is the
    last statement before `set_offer_state` commits. At that instant the automation has
    already run. A reader on a **different connection** — the only place from which a
    committed row and an uncommitted one look different — must still see `inviata` and
    `lead`. Two barriers rather than one: the first releases the reader once the writer is
