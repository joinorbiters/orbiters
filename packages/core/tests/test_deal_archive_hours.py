"""Archiving a deal cannot leave its hours behind in the backlog.

Slice 6 criterion 2: a card and the list behind it must agree. Two figures on the
operational dashboard are computed from the same hours by different routes --
`unbilled_backlog` sums `time_entries` and joins nothing, while
`count_won_deals_to_invoice` joins `deals` and filters `Deal.deleted_at IS NULL` -- so
soft-deleting a deal that still carries a billable, unbilled entry made them disagree.
The dashboard reported valore_maturato against a signal card reading zero, with no row
anywhere to explain the difference and no way to act on it.

**The cure is the guard, not the join, and the choice is the point of this file.** Adding
a `Deal` semi-join to `unbilled_backlog` would fix that one pair and break another:
`week_hours` and `TimeEntryRepository.list` today agree precisely because neither joins
`deals`, so a semi-join added to the aggregate alone would create a fresh criterion-2
violation, and one added to the list as well would make an archived deal's hours
unlistable -- a soft delete that hides a *sibling table's* rows, which is not a soft
delete. Refusing the archive instead establishes one invariant, **no live time entry hangs
off an archived deal**, and every aggregate over `time_entries` and every list beside it
becomes consistent at once without either of them learning about `deals`.

It is also the rule the sibling case already has: `CustomerService.soft_delete` refuses
while `count_active_deals` is non-zero, and `DealService.restore` closes the back door that
would otherwise reintroduce the state from the other side. Both halves are mirrored here,
and the second is tested, because an invariant with a back door is a comment.
