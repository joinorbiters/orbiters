"""A13. The residual document's 2026-08-20 update makes this blocking for slice 4
because this slice's native columns are named `ore`, `data`, `importo` and
`descrizione` -- the first labels anyone would type defining a custom field on an
hours entry. Before this guard, a field labelled "Ore" on `time_entry` slugified to
`ore`, the API answered 201, and every later write landed in `custom_fields.ore`
instead of the real column, silently.

Every `FieldDefinitionCreate(...)` call below passes `key=label`: `key` has no
default derived from `label` at the schema level (it is a required field of its
own, always present in this service's real callers -- the API and MCP layers send
whatever raw text the user typed as `key`, and `_slugify` normalizes it), so a
test exercising "what a user types" must send the raw label-shaped text as `key`
too, exactly as `FieldDefinitionCreate`'s own `_slugify` validator expects it to
arrive.
