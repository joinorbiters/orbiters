"""Spec 4.4: what happens to the mail that arrived *before* the CRM knew the address.

Two mechanisms, deliberately different in kind:

* **Automatic, once, and bounded.** An address the roster gained since the last cycle is
  looked for over `gmail_backfill_days` instead of only since the watermark. It happens
  on the next cycle rather than the instant the person was saved, because `PersonService`
  is not made to learn what Gmail is -- `packages/core` services do not call each other
  for network side effects -- and the interface says so rather than leaving the user to
  discover it.
* **Explicit, human-initiated, unbounded in time only.** `backfill(..., full=True)` drops
  the horizon on one entity. Not a default: on a ten-year mailbox it is slow and nobody
  wants it by accident.

The third guard of spec 4.1 applies to both and is asserted here in the same shape
`test_gmail_sync.py` uses: every address in every recorded listing has to be one the CRM
owns. "No horizon" is about time, never about relevance.
