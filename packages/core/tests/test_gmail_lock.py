"""One mailbox, one cycle at a time -- and the second caller gets an answer.

A cron every fifteen minutes and a human pressing the button is not a hypothetical, so
"already running" has to be a *result* rather than an exception, a wait, or a second
pass over the same thousand messages.

Two of the tests here hold the lock from a second connection, which is a faithful
reproduction rather than an approximation: Postgres advisory locks are per session, so
a second `Session` on its own connection is exactly what a concurrent cron run is. The
two threaded tests go further and overlap for real, in the shape this slice has settled
on for concurrency claims (`test_gmail_models.py`'s single-use race,
`test_gmail_sync.py`'s two overlapping cycles): the `db_session` fixture wraps each
test in a transaction it rolls back, so two connections inside it could never see each
other's rows, and anything that has to race therefore commits for real and cleans up in
a `finally`.
