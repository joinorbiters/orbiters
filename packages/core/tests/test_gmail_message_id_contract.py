"""The fake's send/lookup behaviour must match whatever the note recorded.

This does not verify Gmail -- no test in this slice touches the network, and the root
`conftest.py` makes that a property of the suite rather than a convention. What it
verifies is that `FakeGmail` models the behaviour the note *records*, so every test built
on the fake is testing the recorded contract rather than a convenient one, and so that
changing the record forces the fake (and the setting) to change with it.

The note may record `YES`, `NO` or `UNVERIFIED`, and the third is a real state, not a
placeholder: it is what the record says while the one manual step of plan 5B-2 is still
outstanding. Asserting only on `YES`/`NO` would leave exactly two ways out -- a red suite
forever, or somebody writing `YES` to make it green -- and the second is how an
assumption becomes a fact nobody can find again.
