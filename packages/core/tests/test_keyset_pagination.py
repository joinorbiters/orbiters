"""**Criterion 13.** Ordered pagination loses no row and repeats none.

Two halves, and neither one alone is the criterion.

**The walk.** Every whitelisted sort key of all four listed entities, in both directions,
paged one row at a time and two rows at a time, and the concatenation of the pages
asserted to equal -- element for element, not as a set -- both a single unpaged query and
an order computed here in Python from the seeded values. The union alone is not enough:
a predicate that returns every row in the wrong order still has the right union. The
unpaged query alone is not enough either, because a wrong `order_by` is wrong identically
in both, so the Python-side expectation is what pins the order down independently.

The corpus is built so that the walk can fail. Its sort values **collide** -- three rows
share a surname, three share a timestamp -- because a keyset over a non-unique column is
exactly what the composite cursor exists for, and a fixture whose values are all distinct
cannot catch a tie-breaking bug: a bare-id cursor pages it correctly by accident. They are
also deliberately *not* in insertion order, so an implementation that quietly ordered by
`id` alone would be visible. And `people.cognome` is null on four of the nine rows, so a
one-row page has to cross the null boundary in both directions -- the boundary where
`NULLS FIRST`/`NULLS LAST` and the descending expression disagree, and where task A3's
`desc(nullslast(...))`/`nullslast(desc(...))` defect lived.

**The race.** The walk above runs inside one transaction, where nothing moves. The
property the criterion actually claims is about a scan that overlaps a writer, so the
second half opens two real sessions on `db_engine`, commits inserts from one while the
other pages, and asserts what offset pagination gets wrong by construction: inserting a
row that sorts before the current page shifts every later row down by one, so page two
re-reads the last row of page one and page three skips one entirely.

**Why it needs its own sessions.** `db_session` hands out one savepoint-backed session on
one connection, so a "concurrent" insert made through it is not concurrent at all -- it is
the same transaction. Slice 3's plan records the same limitation for its numbering race.
This test opens two sessions from `db_engine`, commits from one while the other pages, and
cleans up in a `finally`.
