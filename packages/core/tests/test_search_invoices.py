"""§8.1's fifth branch: `causale` by trigram, and `(anno, numero)` by equality when the
term has the shape of a fiscal number.

**This closes a live defect, not a gap in coverage.** `SearchEntity` has declared five
entities since Task A7 and only four were ever queried, so searching an invoice number
answered «Nessun risultato» when the truth was "invoices were not looked at" -- a silent
partial result, which is the exact family §8.6 and criterion 5 exist to forbid. Task A14
found it; this file is what makes the answer true.

The shape cases are the interesting half. `2026/7` and `7/2026` are both how people write
the same number, and `007` means "invoice seven" -- while `007` searched as a trigram over
`causale` means "every invoice whose description contains 007", which is not an answer.

**A bare number is never shorter than three characters**, because `SearchQuery.termine` is
`min_length=3` (§8.2: a trigram index cannot serve a pattern with no trigram in it, and
the palette issues no request below the threshold). So the reachable spelling of "invoice
seven" is `007`, or `2026/7`, and `7` is not a term this branch can ever be asked. The
parser is tested on `7` all the same, because it is a pure function and the bound belongs
to the query schema rather than to it -- but every search below uses a term the palette
could actually send.
