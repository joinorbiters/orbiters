Exact and prefix scores are asserted to the cent, because they are literals. The
substring score is asserted only by *ordering* and by its bounds: the precise value of
`similarity()` is a pg_trgm implementation detail, and pinning it would make a Postgres
upgrade look like a defect in this file.

Every assertion below goes through a real query. That is not incidental: the score being
one SQL expression is the task, because a score computed in Python over fetched rows
cannot be ordered or paged by the database and turns the search into a scan of the whole
trigram tail. `test_the_ranking_happens_in_the_database` is the assertion that says so
directly -- it never fetches a score at all, it asks Postgres to sort by it and take two.
