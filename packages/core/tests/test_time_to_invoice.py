"""**Criterion 5.** Hours become invoice lines, once; and the derived value stops
counting the moment the invoice exists.

The bridge owns no invoicing logic: it builds an `InvoiceCreate` and calls
`InvoiceService`, which stays the sole owner of numbering, fiscal validation, rounding
and freezing (slice 3 §3, §6, §9). This task adds no participant to slice 3's locked
transaction.

Which reading of "already invoiced" each figure uses is the thing this file is most
careful about, because task 4B-3 deliberately left two that differ. The **link-based**
reading is `time_entries.invoice_line_id IS NOT NULL` -- one indexed column, no join --
and it is what the `fatturato` list filter applies. The **invoice-state** reading goes
through `billed_entry_ids`, joins to `invoices` and asks whether the line belongs to an
*issued* one. `bind_time_to_invoice` writes the link, which is what makes the two
readings differ at all; the double-invoicing guard and every P&L figure use the
invoice-state one, because an hour on a *draft* is not revenue yet.
