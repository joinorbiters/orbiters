"""§6.3's method: the backlog, with no period.

Every figure here is slice 4's formula, called rather than reimplemented. The point of the
method existing at all is that `core/dashboard/` cannot contain
`Σ ROUND(ore × tariffa_applicata, 2)` -- it is a product of two columns, and §3 forbids the
dashboard package any multiplication at all.

Two families of test carry the weight.

The first is about hours with no rate: they are counted separately, they contribute
nothing to the accrued value, and they are never treated as zero-rate hours. A rate of
zero and no rate are different facts (slice 4 §5.1), and a silent zero would say the work
was free. Both directions are asserted, because a test that only shows the unpriced row
excluded from the money passes just as happily against an implementation that drops every
row it cannot value.

The second is about what "not yet invoiced" means. Slice 4 settled that question once, in
`billed_entry_ids`, and settled it as a fact about the **invoice's state** rather than
about the presence of the link: an hour attached to a line of a *draft* is still freely
editable, is not revenue, and must therefore still appear in the backlog -- otherwise the
work is priced, done, and invisible in every figure until somebody presses "issue".
`deal_pnl` and `period_pnl` both already read it that way, so the backlog reads it that
way too. The link-based reading is a real alternative and it is the wrong one here; the
tests below pin the difference in both directions, because a predicate nobody has watched
disagree with its rival is a predicate nobody has chosen.
