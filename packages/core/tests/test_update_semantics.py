"""A14, closed. Three spellings, three distinct outcomes, on every service.

Before this change `model_dump(exclude_none=True)` collapsed "supplied as null" into
"omitted", so no `Update` schema could clear a numeric or date column. On
`deals.ore_preventivate` that is not an inconvenience but a correctness defect: `NULL`
means "nobody estimated" and `0` means "estimated zero hours", the budget report treats
them as opposite, and only `0` was writable -- so a wrong estimate stayed stuck and read
as an infinite overrun.

The frontend contract is unchanged and stays as plan 1B fixed it: a native text column
clears on `""`, a custom field clears on `null`, an omitted key clears nothing. What
changes is that a native *numeric* or *date* column now clears on `null`, which nothing
could express before.

The fourth outcome is a refusal, and it is new here too: a `null` aimed at a `NOT NULL`
column used to be silently discarded by `exclude_none`, and would now reach `flush()` as
a raw `IntegrityError` that poisons the caller's session. `reject_cleared_columns` turns
it back into this project's own `ValidationFailed`, before any assignment happens.
