# --- Item 1 (CRITICAL, final review): SafeStr is the one reusable guard against a  --
# --- NUL byte reaching a native String/Text column. Six times this project fixed   --
# --- "an unvalidated input reaches Postgres and comes back as a raw exception" as  --
# --- six separate special cases (max_length, max_digits/decimal_places, fullmatch  --
# --- instead of match, escape_like, ...); NUL bytes in native columns were never   --
# --- swept because no single column shape ever forced it. This is the fix as a    --
# --- class: one annotated type, applied to every user-supplied string field.      --
