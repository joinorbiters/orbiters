"""§6's first two rows: hours per day in the current week, and the days with none.

The second one is the whole task. Slice 4 §13 refuses a stopwatch and names the real
failure it leaves open -- *"non ho mai inserito martedì"* -- and this is the figure that
attacks it. It is also the only figure in this slice with a direct agentic counterpart,
the `ore-da-registrare` prompt of §10.

**A series that silently omits its empty days is a chart that lies about its own shape.**
A week with three worked days and four blank ones must not render as three consecutive
bars, so `giorni` is asserted here as the *full dense range* -- seven entries, in order,
zeros included -- and not as a set of the days that happen to have hours. Every test that
touches the shape checks both ends of the window, because a fill loop is exactly the kind
of code that is right in the middle and wrong on the last day.

The set difference lives in `TimeEntryRepository` rather than in the browser or in
`DashboardService`: deriving it client-side would put business logic in the frontend, and
`DashboardService` may contain no arithmetic at all (§3, and
`test_dashboard_no_arithmetic.py`).
