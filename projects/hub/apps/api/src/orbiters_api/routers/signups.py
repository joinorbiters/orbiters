"""`POST /api/orbiters/signups`: a signup for the Orbiters community.

Public, deliberately: the page that posts here is the community site, and its visitor
has no account -- that is the whole point of the form. The path is the one the website
has always posted to; it moved here from PigroCRM's API on 2026-09-09 with its body,
its answer and its limiter unchanged, so the form and the ad conversion never noticed.

Two properties follow from being public, and both live here:

- The answer is `SignupAck` -- `{"ok": true}` and a 201, the same for a first signup
  and for an address already on the list. It used to be the stored row, which turned
  this endpoint into an oracle: post somebody else's address and the response handed
  back their real nome, cognome and LinkedIn profile. The whole row is admin-gated
  (the admin API of the hub, step 3 of its spec) and stays that way.
- A small per-client rate limit (`ratelimit.py`), shared with the hub's other two public
  writes.

The one thing this route does besides writing the row is measure the ad conversion, in a
background task, after the response. `orbiters_core.conversions` says what is sent
and what deliberately is not; the reason it is here rather than in `SignupService` is
that everything it needs beyond the id -- the visitor's address, their user agent, the
`__obref` cookie -- is a property of this HTTP request and of nothing else.
