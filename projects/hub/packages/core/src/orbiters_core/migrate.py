"""Runs this package's Alembic history against a URL, from Python.

Used by the test fixtures and by anything that must bring a database to `head` without
shelling out: the API container does it with the `alembic` command at start-up, the
tests do it here so the schema they run against is the one the migrations produce and
not one `create_all` invented beside them.
