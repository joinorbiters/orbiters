"""The guide a member downloads, and the three things that can quietly stop being true.

It is a built artefact that is committed: `../../../tools/build_guide_pdf.py` typesets
the Markdown in `../../../content/` with pandoc and Typst, and its docstring says why
neither the API image nor CI does that for itself. The cost of committing it is that the
bytes can fall behind their sources, so `tools/guide-pdf.lock.json` records the SHA-256
of every input and of the output, this file fails when any of them moved, and the
script's own `--check` in preflight rebuilds the PDF and compares it byte for byte on a
machine that has the two binaries. Nothing here needs either of them, which is why it
runs in the hub's own gate on every pull request.
