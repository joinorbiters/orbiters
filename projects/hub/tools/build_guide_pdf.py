"""Build the guide's PDF from its Markdown, or check that the committed one is current.

    uv run python projects/hub/tools/build_guide_pdf.py          # write it
    uv run python projects/hub/tools/build_guide_pdf.py --check  # verify it

The guide is a perk of the community, so it is not a public file: the hub's API serves
it to a member behind their own session (`GET /api/hub/me/guida`), which is why the PDF
lives inside `orbiters_core` as package data rather than in the website's `dist`.
Lorenzo's call on ORB-70, 2026-09-10: «la guida deve essere scaricabile dall'hub una
volta registrati».

**Why the artefact is committed rather than built in the image.** Building it where it
is served would put pandoc, Typst and fontTools inside `Dockerfile.api`, a
`python:3.13-slim` image that today installs one dependency closure and nothing else,
for one 2,500-word document that changes when somebody edits a Markdown file. So the
PDF is generated here and committed; `guide-pdf.lock.json` records the SHA-256 of every
input and of the output, `packages/core/tests/test_guide_pdf.py` fails when a source
moved without a regeneration, and `--check` in preflight rebuilds it and compares the
bytes on a machine that has the three tools. ORB-70 sanctions this shape explicitly, and
it is the same trade the rest of the repository makes: verification moves tiers, it does
not disappear.

**The toolchain is PigroCRM's, not a second one.** pandoc for Markdown to Typst, Typst to
compile, `--creation-timestamp 0` so two runs of the same source produce the same bytes
(`pigrocrm/core/render/pdf.py` explains why that flag is not optional for a hashed
artefact). What is new here is the typeface: the brand ships Outfit as one variable
woff2, Typst reads neither woff2 nor a variable axis ("variable fonts are not currently
supported", and the file's default instance is Thin 100), so fontTools decompresses it
and pins the two weights the site's own stylesheet uses -- 300 for body text, 500 for
headings and strong. The static instances live in a temporary directory and are never
committed: the woff2 in `shared/brand/fonts` stays the single source of the typeface.
