"""§9.6's configuration and §9.5's third observability surface.

`PUT` and not `PATCH`, with both fields optional: the body is a partial update read with
`exclude_unset=True`, and `PUT` is what the shipped `emitter` and `fiscal_profile`
single-row endpoints already use. One convention for single-row configuration.

There is no MCP counterpart for the write, and that is the slice's single declared
exclusion (§11.1). It is enforced by not registering a tool rather than by an
authorisation check, because residuo R10 leaves a personal access token carrying its
owner's full role -- an admin's token would pass any check written inside a tool.
