"""Which invoices are worth chasing, and preparing the letter that chases one.

Two endpoints, and the second one **sends nothing** (spec 8.3). `POST ""` writes a
`payment_reminders` row and a draft, and hands back the draft's id; the draft leaves
through `/api/email-drafts/{id}/send` like any other email. That is what lets spec 7.3
rely on 6.1's idempotence instead of reimplementing it -- one send path in the whole
slice -- and a second one here is exactly where the double send would come back.

`GET /candidates` is a plain read of this installation's own register: it makes no Google
call, spends no Gmail quota and works with the mailbox disconnected (the reply signal
degrades to `null` rather than to "nobody replied"). It is therefore not role-gated --
seeing which invoices are late is reading your own books. What is gated is preparing the
reminder, because that writes a demand for payment in the owner's name.
