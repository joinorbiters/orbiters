    """FastAPI runs sync dependencies in a thread pool: several requests can reach
    get_session()'s cold-start check before the first one finishes building the
    registry. A naive check-then-act on the module global would let each of them build
    (and leak) its own `SpaceRegistry`, and the registry's own double-checked lock
    (`SpaceRegistry.session_factory`) is what then keeps two threads sharing that one
    registry from building two root engines.

    This drives many threads through that window at once. `create_engine_from_settings`
    (called from `SpaceRegistry.session_factory`, ORB-170) is wrapped with an artificial
    delay and does not touch a real database -- creating a SQLAlchemy Engine never
    connects eagerly -- so the race is exercised deterministically: the delay only widens
    a window that already exists, it does not manufacture one that would not otherwise be
    there.
