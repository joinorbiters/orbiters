"""Who is calling, over HTTP: one actor per request, carried on a ContextVar.

Over stdio the actor is resolved once at start-up and never changes (`__main__.py`).
Over HTTP every request carries its own bearer token, so the actor is resolved per
request by `pigrocrm_mcp.http` and stamped on the ASGI scope; `ActorFromRequest` is
the SDK's context-tier middleware that copies it from `ctx.request.state` into a
`ContextVar` for the duration of the call, and `RequestActorProvider` is the
`ActorProvider` `build_server` reads it back through. A `ContextVar`, like
`ScopedSessionProvider`'s session, because the SDK dispatches tools both on the event
loop and in a thread pool, and a `ContextVar` is the one primitive correct for both.
