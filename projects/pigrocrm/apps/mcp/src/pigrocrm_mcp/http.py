"""The MCP server over Streamable HTTP, one endpoint per space (ORB-170).

`/<slug>/mcp` and `/mcp` (the root), served by the `mcp` compose service behind the
web container's nginx. A pure ASGI application rather than a Starlette one, because it
has to rewrite the path *before* routing and stamp the actor on the scope, exactly as
`pigrocrm_api.tenancy.TenantPrefixMiddleware` does for the API -- and because the SDK's
own Starlette app, one per space, is what it dispatches to.

The three answers every request needs come from `SpaceRegistry` (which database, what
the space's settings are, which rows lay over them); the credential is a personal
access token as a bearer, resolved by `PatService.resolve` on the space's database with
the space's settings applied, so `Actor.full_access` is the space's answer. Everything
is lazy: importing this module opens nothing, and a space's server is built on its
first request and rebuilt when its settings rows change.

Why one `MCPServer` per space: `build_server` registers tools according to the settings
it receives (`mcp_full_access`, whether Google is configured), so a process serving
several spaces cannot share one tool list.

Why an anyio task group of its own: the Starlette app the SDK returns has a lifespan
that starts its session manager, without which every request fails. Space apps are
built inside a request, so their lifespan is entered by a task spawned in a group this
application opens once for the whole process, and left when the process stops --
anyio does not allow entering a scope in one task and leaving it in another.
