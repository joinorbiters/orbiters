"""What an agent may do with Google Drive today: diagnose it, and nothing else.

This module is one tool, `describe_drive_account`, and it is the whole surface for a
deliberate reason -- 9B ships the credential and the folder configuration, not a single
byte read from Drive. There is nothing yet for an agent to fetch, so there is nothing
yet to gate behind `mcp_full_access`; 9C is where reading a document arrives, and where
that question gets asked again.

**Why this one tool is not privileged.** One Google OAuth client issues both the Gmail
grant and this one (`gmail_configured` gates both, and the tool is registered right
after `gmail_tools.register` in the same block for exactly that reason), and diagnosing
a credential's state costs no quota and exercises no consent -- the same reasoning
`describe_gmail_account` already rests on in `tools/gmail.py`. An agent that cannot see
whether Drive is connected, expiring or revoked either treats a dead credential as live
or, worse, has no way to tell a person what needs fixing. Reading that state is not a
capability over Drive; it is a capability over the CRM's own record of Drive, exactly as
`describe_gmail_account` is a capability over the CRM's record of Gmail and not over the
mailbox itself.

**Why nothing else is here yet.** `GoogleDriveOAuthService.start/complete/disconnect`
and `GoogleDriveAccountService.set_roots` are refused for the same reasons their Gmail
twins are (see `test_mcp_surface_coverage.py`'s exclusions): consenting to and
configuring a third-party grant are a person's decisions, taken from a browser redirect
or a settings screen, not an agent's. `usable` and `mark_revoked` are internal gates and
system-only bookkeeping, never called with an actor performing an operation. None of
that changes here -- this module adds the one read `health()` already made possible and
touches nothing else.
