"""What an agent may do with the mail, and what it may not.

The asymmetry is the design. Everywhere else on this surface the rule is "an agent can
do anything a person can, minus a named list"; here the list is most of the feature, and
each refusal answers the same question in a different place: *whose resource is this, and
whose decision?*

**Granted, reading.** The stored mirror -- `list_gmail_messages`, `get_gmail_message` --
the credential's state, `describe_gmail_account`, and the list of invoices worth chasing,
`list_payment_reminder_candidates`. All four read rows this CRM already holds. None makes
a Google call, none spends the owner's Gmail quota, none exercises the owner's consent,
and all four keep working with the mailbox disconnected. That is the whole test: an
operation that only reads what the CRM already decided to keep is an operation an agent
may perform. `list_payment_reminder_candidates` is the one that earns its place rather
than merely qualifying for it -- crossing due dates against payments against what has
already gone out is the laborious part of chasing money, and pressing a button never was.

**Granted, writing: `draft_email`, and nothing else.** Spec 8.1 puts the agent's value
exactly here -- «prepara l'email di accompagnamento all'offerta» -- and the draft it
writes is inert: a row in this CRM, editable, that no tool on this surface can send. The
objection that this is half an operation whose other half is refused is answered by
inverting it. The other half is *a person*, deliberately, and a draft is the artefact
that makes a review cheap: somebody reads the text, changes what they want, and presses
Invia. What would be indefensible is the opposite pairing -- an agent that could send but
not draft.

The line between `draft_email` and the two reminder writes is not read-versus-write and
not caution. It is that a covering email is neutral text somebody asked for, while
`SollecitiService.create_reminder` writes a demand for money in the owner's name, with
the owner's IBAN in it, and *consumes* one of the three positions the register allows per
invoice -- so an agent preparing reminders would spend the ceiling that stops a disputed
invoice becoming an automated persecution, without anybody having decided to chase that
invoice at all. Preparing it is a decision; listing what could be chased is not.

**Refused, and not by omission.**

* *Fetching* -- `GmailSyncService.sync` and `.backfill`. The consent to read a
  third-party mailbox belongs to the person, and so does the moment it is spent: a fetch
  runs under that person's OAuth grant and against that person's Gmail quota, so an
  agent invoking it -- or retrying it -- spends a resource that is not its own.
  `backfill(full=True)` is the same thing at maximum scale, which is why spec 4.4 wants
  it human-initiated. It takes nothing from the agent: what an agent needs to read is
  the mirror, which the person's button or cron keeps current, and
  `describe_gmail_account` is how it finds out whether that mirror is current.
* *Connecting, disconnecting, and choosing what the CRM keeps.* Which mailbox this
  installation may read, and whether the body of that correspondence is stored at all,
  are decisions about somebody's own private data. An agent that could turn
  `gmail_store_bodies` on would be an agent widening what it is allowed to read.
* *Sending.* There is no send tool and there will not be one on this surface. An email
  sent from your mailbox cannot be recalled and the client reads it as your words; and
  an agent holding *read* of the mail and *send* in the same belt has the injection
  source and the exfiltration channel on one channel. A body reaching an agent is
  attacker-controlled text -- `get_gmail_message` labels it as such -- and the thing
  that keeps that from being a hole is that there is nowhere for it to send anything.
* *Rewriting, reading back or discarding somebody's unsent text* --
  `EmailDraftService.update`, `.get`, `.list`, `.delete`. `draft_email` hands its answer
  straight back, so an agent already has what it wrote; what these would add is the
  ability to reach a draft it did *not* write. Two things break if it can. A draft a
  person has read and is about to send could be rewritten underneath them, so the text
  that leaves is not the text that was reviewed -- and the review is the entire reason
  the send is safe to expose to a human at all. And `list` is an index of everybody's
  unsent private correspondence, including every payment reminder with an IBAN in it.
  `delete` has no inverse: the row genuinely disappears.
* *Any tool taking a Gmail search string.* Every guarantee of spec 4 -- the address
  filter, the roster, "an empty roster issues no request at all" -- is one free-text
  parameter away from being nothing. There is no `q` here and there is no room for one.
  `draft_email` does take three free-text parameters, and they are the first on this
  surface: they are admissible for a mechanical reason rather than a judgement -- each is
  validated by `EmailDraftCreate` (`SafeStr`, `max_length`) and none of them ever reaches
  a Gmail query. They become the headers and the body of a local row and stop there.

None of the refusals is a permission check inside a registered tool. A PAT inherits its
owner's full role and never expires (residuo R10), so a check inside a registered tool
is a check an administrator's token passes; the only mechanism that holds is that the
tool does not exist. The durable list is in `test_mcp_invoice_ban.py`, beside the sixteen
fiscal and configuration refusals it belongs with.

**Residuo R1 is not fixed here.** The MCP server still shares one `Session` across
concurrent calls in the plain-callable-provider configuration. Four of these five tools
are short reads and do not widen that window; `draft_email` is a single-row insert that
commits on its own behalf, which is the same shape as every other write tool on this
surface. Nothing in this module addresses R1 and it must not be read as having.
