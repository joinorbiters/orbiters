"""The MCP surface of slice 9B's Drive diagnosis, and why it is one tool and not zero.

`describe_drive_account` is registered in the same `if gmail_configured(settings):`
block as the five Gmail tools, right after them -- one Google OAuth client serves both
credentials, so "is Google configured at all" is one fact, not two. Unlike every writing
or fetching operation on this surface, diagnosing the Drive credential is not gated
behind `mcp_full_access`: reading `GoogleDriveAccountService.health` costs no quota and
exercises no consent, exactly the reasoning `describe_gmail_account` already rests on in
`tools/gmail.py`.

The proof that this tool never reaches Google is the repository-root socket guard: it
fails any test that opens one, so a tool that grew a fetch would fail this file rather
than pass it quietly.
