"""The MCP half. Same service, same figures, one call.

Spec §11.1 lists `search_everything` on both surfaces. The reason it is a tool rather than
four is the same reason it is one service method: an agent that had to call four searches
and merge them would be doing in a transcript what the service already does in one query.

**The docstring is tested, not just written.** A tool's docstring is its contract with the
agent -- it is the only documentation the model ever sees -- so the two promises it makes
are executable here: that a fragment in the middle of a word finds the row (the "34567
finds P.IVA 01234567890" example, which task A8's deviation from spec §8.5 is what makes
true), and that three characters are the minimum. A docstring that promised something the
code did not do would mislead every agent that read it and no test would notice.
