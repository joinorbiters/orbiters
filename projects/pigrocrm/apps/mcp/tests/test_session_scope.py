"""R1, reproduced and then closed.

The slice 1A reviewer measured 10 concurrent `create_customer` calls against one
shared Session as 0 successes and 0 rows. `log_time` (slice 4) is a write tool and
the centre of this slice's agentic surface, so that measurement is the exact
behaviour this test refuses to ship.

Uses `Engine`-backed real sessions, not the `mcp_session` savepoint fixture: the
whole point is that each thread gets its own connection and its own transaction,
which a shared savepoint session cannot express.
