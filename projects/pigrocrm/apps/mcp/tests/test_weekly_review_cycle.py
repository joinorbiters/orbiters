"""**Criterion 15**, the agent half. The human half is `apps/web/e2e/dashboard.spec.ts`.

The criterion's own shape is "Claude does this, the human does that", so it is split across
two surfaces rather than driven from one place. That is not a weakening, and it is not a
choice either: `apps/mcp/ruff.toml` forbids importing `pigrocrm_api` under `TID251` and
`apps/api/ruff.toml` forbids `pigrocrm_mcp` symmetrically, which is the guarantee that keeps
the two adapters adapters instead of a distributed monolith. `test_full_cycle.py` met the
same wall for criterion 12 and answered it the same way; the precedent is followed here
rather than the rule fought.

**What this file adds to a suite that already tests all four pieces.** `test_mcp_prompts.py`
renders `revisione-pipeline`, `test_mcp_dashboard.py` calls `get_commercial_dashboard` and
pins the absent `update_automation_config`, `test_mcp_search.py` searches a P.IVA fragment.
Each of them proves its own piece against its own corpus. None of them proves that the
pieces **join up** -- that the deal the briefing calls stalled is the deal the dashboard
counts, that the customer behind it is reachable from a fragment of the VAT number the
briefing never printed, and that the same corpus supports all of it at once. A weekly review
is that sequence, and the sequence is what an agent actually performs.

**This file builds its own server, and that is the subject as much as the setup.** The
package's `server` fixture wires `build_server(lambda: mcp_session, ...)`: one `Session`
shared by every call, held open inside an outer transaction. `DashboardService` refuses such
a session by design -- a dashboard that cannot set `REPEATABLE READ` is a dashboard whose
cards can disagree with their own drill-throughs -- so the server here is wired the way
`__main__.py` wires production, with a `ScopedSessionProvider` handing out one session per
logical call. `test_mcp_dashboard.py::test_the_shared_session_fixture_is_refused_loudly`
pins that this is a property of the service and not a quirk of the plumbing.

The corpus is committed, because a scoped session never sees another transaction's
uncommitted rows, and it is **additive**: `mcp_engine` is session-scoped and earlier files in
this package commit rows that outlive them, so this file creates two stages of its own
instead of seeding the defaults, keys every assertion on its own prefix, and removes only
its own rows on the way out.
