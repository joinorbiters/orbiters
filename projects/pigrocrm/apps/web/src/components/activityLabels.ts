 * and a second `KIND_LABELS` table is how two screens start calling the same event two
 * different things. `Timeline.tsx` still owns everything that is about *its* rendering --
 * the actor badge, the payload detail -- because none of that is shared.
 *
 * A plain module, not a `.tsx`: it exports no component, so there is no
 * `react-refresh/only-export-components` override to buy it. That is the same reason
 * `lib/dates.ts` and `features/dashboard/periodo.ts` exist as modules of their own.
