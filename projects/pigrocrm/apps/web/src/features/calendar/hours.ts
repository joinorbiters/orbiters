 * A guard and not the rule. `ck_time_entries_ore_range` and `TimeEntryCreate` are the
 * authority and their refusal is the sentence the panel shows; what this avoids is a
 * pointless round trip for `""`, `-1` or `otto`, and a button that looks live while it
 * cannot possibly work.
 *
 * The comma is accepted and turned into a dot: an Italian keyboard produces `7,5`, and
 * refusing that would be refusing the number for the shape of its separator. Nothing
 * else is coerced -- `8h`, `8 ore` and `otto` are not hours, and guessing at them is how
 * a typo becomes a wrong figure in a P&L.
