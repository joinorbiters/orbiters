/**
 * The calendar's arithmetic, kept pure so it can be proven with no React and no network.
 *
 * Every date is built from and read as **local** year/month/day parts, through
 * `lib/dates.ts` and never through a private copy: `toISOString()` is what moved a
 * 31 March 23:30 CEST entry into April, and `new Date("2026-03-10")` parses as UTC
 * midnight and renders as 9 March anywhere behind UTC. `features/time/week.ts` says the
 * same thing about the week; this module adds no sixth copy of those four lines.
 *
 * Hours are summed in integer hundredths through `lib/decimal.ts`, the only arithmetic
 * the browser is allowed to do: every economic figure arrives already summed from the
 * API, and `no-float-money.test.ts` fails the build if a module adds one.
