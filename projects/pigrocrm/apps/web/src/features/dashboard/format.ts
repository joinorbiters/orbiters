/**
 * The three display formatters the dashboard tabs share.
 *
 * Extracted rather than copied a third time. The precedent this codebase records for a
 * money formatter is a *per-feature* private helper (`features/deals/columns.tsx`), and
 * that reasoning holds for one copy: `CommercialTab.tsx` carried its own `money` and
 * `percent` and was right to. It stops holding at three. `lib/dates.ts` exists for exactly
 * this reason and says so at length -- five identical copies of a four-line date function,
 * each individually justified, and the next person to fix a bug in one had to find all
 * five. Three tabs in one folder rendering the same `Numeric(12, 2)` column is the same
 * shape, and a `percent` that drifted in one of them would print `0,00%` where a sibling
 * printed a dash for the same null.
 *
 * A plain module, not a `.tsx`: it exports no component, so there is no
 * `react-refresh/only-export-components` override to buy it -- the same reason `periodo.ts`
 * sits beside `PeriodPicker.tsx` rather than inside it.
 *
 * **Nothing here parses a number.** `no-browser-arithmetic.test.ts` scans this folder for
 * `Number()`, `parseFloat`, `parseInt` and unary `+`; `no-float-money.test.ts` scans the
 * whole of `src` for arithmetic on a named economic field. Both stay green because every
 * value below is formatted as the string the API sent.

 * how cents disappear. `Intl.NumberFormat.format` accepts a string and parses it with full
 * decimal precision (ES2023.Intl, which this project's tsconfig already declares for
 * `useGrouping: 'always'`).
 *
 * The cast is to `Intl.StringNumericLiteral` -- the template-literal type that signature
 * actually takes, `` `${number}` | "Infinity" | ... `` -- and not to `number`, which would
 * be a lie about what is passed. A `Numeric(12, 2)` column always arrives in that shape.
