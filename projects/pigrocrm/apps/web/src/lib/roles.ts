 * A role as the product writes it: «admin» is the value the API stores, not a word that
 * belongs on a screen (spec §5.5 — everything the user reads is Italian).
 *
 * Lower case, because both readers put it inside a sentence or under a name rather than
 * at the head of one; `features/settings/UsersPanel.tsx` keeps its own capitalised set
 * for the options of a `<Select>`, which is a list of titles and not prose.
 *
 * Its own module and not `lib/auth.tsx`: every test of a component that shows a role
 * mocks `@/lib/auth` wholesale, and a constant living there would come back undefined in
 * all of them.
