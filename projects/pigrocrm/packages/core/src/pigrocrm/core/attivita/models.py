    """One commitment with a state: the table slice 7 specified and slice 10 built.

    Not a `kind` of `activities` and not a generalisation of `payment_reminders`, and
    the spec of 2026-09-03 §2 argues both at length. In short: `activities` is
    append-only, so giving it a state would mean either a second timeline row per
    rewrite or a timeline that is no longer append-only; `payment_reminders` knows only
    about invoices, and its `livello` and its per-invoice ceiling are rules of a
    reminder rather than of a commitment.

    **`scadenza` is nullable on purpose** (spec §3.2). The commonest to-do has no date
    -- «ask Rossi for the codice SDI» is a real commitment that does not fall due on
    Thursday -- and a required date produces one of two bad outcomes: an invented date,
    which poisons every «what is due» list from then on, or the commitment not being
    recorded at all. The consequence has to be respected everywhere: an activity with
    no date is not late, is not for today, and appears in no count ordered by date. It
    is the same lesson `documents.stato_dal` taught in slice 6C -- **a NULL is not zero
    days.**

    **Three states, not two.** `annullata` exists because the thing worth knowing six
    months later is not «this disappeared» but *why*: «chase Rossi» cancelled because
    Rossi paid is information, and the same row deleted is a hole. The soft delete stays
    for the typo -- I created the wrong activity -- and not for the change of plan.

    **At most one reference, and zero is legitimate.** «Do March's e-invoicing» belongs
    to no customer. Two would be an activity that appears on two records and gets closed
    on one of them. This is deliberately *different* from `documents`, where slice 2
    requires exactly one of customer and deal: a document is a fact about somebody, a
    commitment can be about nobody but you.
