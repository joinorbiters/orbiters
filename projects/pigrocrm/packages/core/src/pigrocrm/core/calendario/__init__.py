"""Il calendario: one month of what was worked and what falls due, in one read.

No model of its own. Everything here is a *view* over three tables that already exist --
`time_entries`, `attivita`, `invoices` -- which is the whole design of slice 10: the CRM
already knew all of this, in three places, and nobody could ask it by day.
