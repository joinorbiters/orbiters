class GoogleDriveAccount(Base, PrimaryKeyMixin, TimestampMixin):
    """One connected Drive, per CRM user (spec 9 §5.2).

    A **second** credential, not a wider `GoogleAccount`, because a Drive connection and
    a Gmail connection are two separate grants that a person can hold, revoke and reconnect
    independently of one another: consenting to Drive says nothing about Gmail, and
    disconnecting Gmail must not touch a Drive credential that was never in question.
    `google_sub` on this row can, and normally will, equal the `google_sub` on that
    user's `GoogleAccount` -- the same Google identity, granting the CRM a second,
    separate set of scopes -- but the two rows share no foreign key between them and
    fail independently.

    `status` carries the same four values, and the same distinction, that `GoogleAccount.
    status`'s docstring works through for Gmail: `active` (nothing to do), `expired` (our
    own prediction that the consent window has lapsed), `revoked` (what Google told us),
    `disconnected` (what the user did, from Impostazioni → Drive). The same argument
    applies unchanged -- a mailbox and a Drive folder are different resources, but the
    four things that can be true of a Google OAuth grant are the same four things
    whichever resource it grants access to -- so the column is kept apart from status
    rather than shared with it, for the same reason `disconnected` was split from
    `revoked` there: a view is not the place to reconstruct which of two events happened
    from a nullable timestamp.

    `root_folder_ids`, `storage_folder_id` and `storage_folder_verified` have no
    equivalent on `GoogleAccount`: they
    are Drive's own configuration, not the credential's. `root_folder_ids` is the set of
    folders the CRM is allowed to read from; `storage_folder_id` is the one folder it may
    write generated documents into. Both are Drive file ids, never a query nor free text,
    which is what `drive/schemas.py`'s `DriveRootsUpdate` pattern enforces before either
    ever reaches this table.

    Nothing on this class is safe to print. There is deliberately no `__repr__`, for the
    same reason `GoogleAccount` has none: the inherited `object.__repr__` prints the
    class and an address and nothing else, which is the behaviour the two
    `refresh_token_*` columns need from every traceback and every debugger frame.
