"""The text of one attachment of an archived message -- fetched now, kept never.

Spec 5.4 says the sync stores a name, a mime type and a size of an attachment and
never its bytes, and that decision is not being reopened here: a mailbox's attachments
are somebody's contracts, payslips and scans, and a CRM that copied them all would be
holding a second, unaudited archive of them. What was missing is the other half --
that a fact written *only* inside one of those files was, until this module, out of
reach for good. A codice destinatario on a signed order form is the case that forced
it: it exists in no email body, in no CRM field, and in exactly one PDF.

So this reads one attachment, on demand, named by whoever is asking, and returns its
**text**:

  * nothing is written -- not the bytes, not the extracted text, not an activity row.
    The read leaves no trace in the CRM, which is what keeps spec 5.4 true;
  * it goes to Google live, on the titolare's own OAuth grant and quota, which is why
    the tool that exposes it lives among the privileged ones, beside
    `discover_gmail_correspondents`;
  * the answer carries the provenance sentence of a *received* mail. These bytes were
    written by whoever sent the message, not by the titolare, and they reach an agent
    that reads its own instructions as text.

The extractor is `core/text.py`, the same one Drive and the document archive use, with
the same discipline: nothing raises on a strange file, an unreadable type answers the
empty string with its own mime, and `troncato` says only whether something was cut.

Nothing here logs and no attachment content reaches an exception message. A filename
does -- a caller has to be told which attachment it asked for and which ones exist --
and the bytes never.
