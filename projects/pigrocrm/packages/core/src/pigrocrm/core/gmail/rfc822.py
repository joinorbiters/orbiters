"""Building the message Gmail will send.

Same structure as the previous system's `buildRawEmailMessage` -- `multipart/mixed`, base64url for
the `raw` field -- and none of its three defects:

1. **`Message-ID` is always present**, generated here, with the right-hand side derived
   from the configured domain. It is what makes the thread correct when the client
   replies, and what makes the reconciliation of spec 6.3 exact rather than heuristic.
2. **`In-Reply-To` and `References` are set** when replying or chasing inside an
   existing thread. Without them the reminder arrives detached, and the first thing the
   recipient does is ask for the invoice again.
3. **The body declares `quoted-printable` or `base64`, with `charset="UTF-8"`. Never
   `7bit`.** the previous system declares `7bit` over text containing `à` and `’`; it works by
   accident until the first client that takes the declaration literally.

Built on `email.message.EmailMessage` from the standard library rather than by string
concatenation. That is the point of the third defect: the encoding rules are subtle,
they are already implemented correctly, and hand-rolling them is what produced the bug.

Nothing here logs, and nothing that leaves this module carries a body or an address: a
`ValidationFailed` raised below names the *field* and, for an address, quotes only the
one value the caller must fix. The bodies passing through are somebody's private
correspondence.
