"""The money arithmetic of spec 6.1, as pure functions over `Decimal`.

No `float` reaches this module and none leaves it. the previous system applied a percentage to a
total it had re-read out of a formatted string (`parseAmount(values.TOTALE)`); here an
amount is only ever a `Decimal` computed from other `Decimal`s, and text is produced
at the very end by `format_amount_*` for the XML and the PDF, never parsed back.

Kept free of the database, the regime and the exporter on purpose: rules 2 and 3 below
disagree by cents, the disagreement is invisible under the forfettario the product
ships with, and the only way to pin them is a test with rates nobody uses -- which
needs no session, no container and no XML.
