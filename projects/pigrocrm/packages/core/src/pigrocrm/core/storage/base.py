# A key is a relative POSIX-style path: segments of `[a-z0-9._-]`, separated by a
# single `/`, each segment starting with a lowercase alphanumeric. `re.fullmatch` below,
# never `re.match` with `$`, because `$` matches before a trailing newline -- which would
# let "a.pdf\n" through and reach the filesystem, and reach the `String(255)` column, as
# something neither had agreed to.
#
# Lowercase-only is a deliberate override of what an earlier version of this function
# allowed (`A-Z` too) -- see task-4-report.md, "Fix round 1". Two keys differing only in
# case are different Python strings but can name the *same* file on a case-insensitive
# filesystem (macOS/APFS and Windows/NTFS by default): `put("ACME/V1.PDF", b)` after
# `put("acme/v1.pdf", a)` silently leaves one file containing `b`, with no exception on
# either call -- reproduced through the real API, not assumed. The keys this system
# actually generates -- a slug plus hex UUID fragments -- are already lowercase, so
# nothing real is lost by refusing the rest outright. It also keeps the two backends the
# next task must make interchangeable from disagreeing about identity: Google Drive is
# case-sensitive, macOS is not, and a key that is safe (unambiguous) for one and not the
# other is not safe -- the same principle the rest of this function already follows for
# Windows-reserved names below.
#
# The character class is otherwise ASCII-only by construction (no `\w`, no Unicode
# letters), which is also what makes Unicode normalisation a non-issue: none of
# `a-z0-9._-` or `/` has more than one Unicode Normalization Form, so any key this
# pattern accepts is already identical under NFC and NFD. A key that is *not* ASCII is
# refused outright, not silently re-encoded.

# future remote backend shares (see the module docstring), and a key that is safe for

    read-*your-own*-writes, not global strong consistency -- a backend is free to take

    matters because a remote object store may not promise the stronger property
    unconditionally the instant an upload response returns, and this Protocol must not
    quietly assume it does. It does not promise durability either: a successful `put`
    means the call did not raise, not that the bytes have survived a concurrent power
    loss or reached every replica -- `LocalFileStorage` writes atomically (see `put`)
    but does not `fsync`, which is a deliberate match to what an honest remote backend
