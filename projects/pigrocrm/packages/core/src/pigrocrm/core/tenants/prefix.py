"""Which space a request belongs to, read from the first segment of its path.

`/<slug>/api/...` and `/<slug>/health` are a space's requests to the API;
`/<slug>/mcp` is a space's request to the MCP server. Both adapters strip the prefix so
that their routes know nothing about tenants, and both apply the same three rules: a
reserved word is not a slug, a malformed segment is not a slug, and the root
installation's own name (`PIGROCRM_ROOT_SLUG`) is stripped like a space's but stays the
root. One function, parametrised on the segments an adapter serves, so the two cannot
drift -- this used to live in `apps/api/tenancy.py` alone.
