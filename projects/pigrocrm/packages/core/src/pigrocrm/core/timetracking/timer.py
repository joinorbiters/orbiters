"""The running timer: start, adjust, stop into an entry, or throw away.

Slice 4 §13 argued that a stopwatch costs three mechanisms and does nothing about the
Tuesday nobody entered. The grid still attacks that failure; this module adds the
stopwatch beside it because Ivan asked for the Toggl/Clockify shape on 2026-09-09, and
it costs one mechanism here, not three: the session is a row (`TimeTimer`), the browser
closing loses nothing because the row is on the server, and the second device sees the
same row. Recovery is reading it back.

What this module never does is write an hour of its own. `stop` builds a
`TimeEntryCreate` and hands it to `TimeEntryService.create`, so the frozen rate, the
period lock, the "not in the future" check, the closed-deal warning and the activity
row are the same ones every other path produces. A timer is a way of *measuring* the
hours; the entry is still the entry.
