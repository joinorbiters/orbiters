"""An issued, unpaid invoice, built as a row rather than through an emission.

`conftest.py` already owns the fixtures that go through `InvoiceService.issue`, and
those are the right ones for anything that tests the *register*: they consume a real
number, render a PDF and freeze a snapshot. Nothing in `solleciti` cares about any of
that. What a reminder needs from an invoice is its state -- issued, unpaid, past its due
date -- so building the row directly keeps these tests to the thing under test and off
the Typst renderer.

A module under `fakes/` and not a `conftest.py` helper, for the reason
`gmail_fixtures.py` states at length: this repository has three test roots, none with an
`__init__.py`, so `conftest` is an ambiguous top-level module name while
`fakes.invoice_fixtures` is unambiguous however the roots are combined.

Every constraint on `invoices` is respected here rather than worked around, because a
fixture that reached the database by relaxing a `CHECK` would be testing a shape
production cannot hold: `anno` and `numero` travel together, `numero` implies an issued
`fattura`, and `(anno, numero)` is unique. The year is derived from the caller's own
`due` date -- which comes from `oggi_in_italia()` -- and never from a literal, so this
file does not expire.
