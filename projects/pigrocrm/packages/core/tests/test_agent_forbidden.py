"""The operations closed to agents, closed on the credential and not on the tool.

Found by review, and it is the one finding that changed the project's threat model.

`apps/mcp/tests/test_mcp_invoice_ban.py` guarantees these operations are unreachable
*structurally* — the MCP tool is not registered — and argues, correctly, that a role
check would guarantee nothing, because a personal access token inherits its owner's full
role and an administrator's token passes any role check.

The gap was that the credential is not confined to the transport. `PatService.resolve`
answers with `Actor(type="mcp", role=<owner's role>)`, and `apps/api`'s `get_actor`
accepts the same `Bearer pgc_…` header on **every** REST route; nothing in that package
ever read `actor.type`. A token given to an agent on the written promise that it "may
prepare but may not emit" could issue an invoice with one `curl` — spending a register
number and producing a FatturaPA, with no way back.

These tests are on `Actor` rather than on a route on purpose. The defect was that the
rule lived in one adapter's tool registry; putting the fix in `packages/core` is what
makes it true of every caller, including one nobody has written yet.
