"""§4.3, at full strength. The rule attaches to the **state of the invoice**, not to the
mere presence of the link, because a draft is still freely editable: while the invoice is
a draft the hours stay modifiable, and slice 3's wholesale line replacement unbinds and
rebinds them without orphans. The moment `issue()` commits, the bound hours are frozen --
without `issue()` having had to know they exist.

Part of criterion 5.
