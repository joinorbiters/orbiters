"""The project's only clock.

`datetime.now(UTC).date()` is wrong for every figure in this slice, and wrong in a way
that is invisible for twenty-three hours a day: at 00:30 on 1 April in Rome it is still
31 March in UTC, so a deal won just after midnight lands in the previous month's
conversion rate. `deals.chiuso_il`, `documents.stato_dal`, `invoices.data_emissione`,
`costs.data` and `time_entries.data` are all calendar dates in the *emitter's* day, not
instants, and slice 3 §6.2 already fixed that rule -- this module is the mechanism.

Two clocks in one product is a bug that shows up on 31 December, which is the worst
possible day to find it. That sentence is why this file does more than the brief asked
for. `pigrocrm.core.clock.oggi_in_italia()` already existed and already had a commit
(875a1f9) behind it fixing three production sites that read the wrong day; adding a
second, settings-driven day function beside it would have been the very defect the
module is named after. So `oggi_in_italia()` is now a thin alias over `today_local()`,
and `test_oggi_in_italia_reads_the_same_instant_as_today_local` is what proves the two
are one mechanism rather than two that happen to agree today.

The AST scan at the bottom is the other half. The brief's own interface section says
"nothing else in the project may call `date.today()` or `datetime.now(UTC).date()`" and
defers the enforcement to Task B9 -- whose brief turns out to enforce something else
entirely (the dashboard's arithmetic). A rule stated in a docstring and enforced
nowhere is a rule that lasts until the next contributor, which is exactly how the three
sites 875a1f9 fixed came to exist. The scan is modelled on
`apps/mcp/tests/test_mcp_invoice_ban.py`, the repository's precedent for this shape.
