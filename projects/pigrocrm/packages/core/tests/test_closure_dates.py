"""The two date columns §4.1 adds, and the asymmetry that decides their backfill.

`Date`, not `timestamptz`, against slice 1 §5's general convention and for slice 3 §6.2's
precise reason: a date that decides which period a figure falls in is not an instant. All
of this slice's period filters land on `Date` columns -- `invoices.data_emissione`,
`costs.data`, `time_entries.data`, `chiuso_il` -- and no mixed comparison exists anywhere.

Two of the tests below freeze `orologio.ISTANTE` rather than comparing against
`today_local()`. Comparing against `today_local()` is what the brief asked for and it
proves less than it looks: `date.today()` returns the same answer for twenty-three hours
of every day, so such an assertion passes against the exact defect commit 875a1f9 had to
fix three times. The frozen instant is 00:30 on 1 January in Rome, 23:30 on 31 December in
UTC, where the two clocks disagree about the day, the month and the year at once.
