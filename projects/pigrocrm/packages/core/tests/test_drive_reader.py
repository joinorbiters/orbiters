"""`DriveReader`: the children of the configured roots, the text of one file, nothing
else.

The failure spec 9C names is reading somebody's Drive -- the photos of their children,
their rent contract, the folder of another job. Three guards stand between this code
and that, and this file is the third: `drive/query.py` refuses to *build* a widened
listing, `test_drive_query.py` refuses to let a Drive URL be written anywhere else,
and the tests here inspect what the fake transport was actually *asked*. The first two
would both accept `children_query("<a folder in somebody's Drive>")`; only this one
can tell that the folder named in the request belongs to the hierarchy the titolare
configured -- which is why `test_every_files_list_of_this_module_stayed_inside_the_roots`
at the bottom re-reads every request every scenario above made.

The other property under test is the one that has no message: a folder or a file
outside the roots is `NotFound`, and it is `NotFound` in the same words whether it does
not exist, exists in a part of the Drive the titolare did not configure, or exists in
somebody else's Drive entirely. Telling those apart would answer the question "is
there a file with this id?" for anyone who can call the tool.
