"""`GmailAttachmentService.attachment_text`: the file the sync never kept, read now.

The property under test is not "PDFs can be parsed" -- `test_text.py` owns that. It is
the bargain this module makes with spec 5.4: the bytes of an attachment are never
stored, so the only honest way to reach a fact written inside one is to fetch it at the
moment somebody asks, extract the text, and keep nothing. So these tests hold to four
things: the right part is fetched, the ceiling refuses rather than truncates, nothing is
written, and the answer says whose words those are.
