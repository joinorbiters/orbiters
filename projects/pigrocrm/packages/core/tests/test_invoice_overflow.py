"""A derived amount that will not fit `Numeric(12, 2)` is refused, not flushed.

`invoices/schemas.py`'s header records that this project has paid for the same class of
defect several times: a value beyond a column's capacity reaches Postgres as
`NumericValueOutOfRange`, SQLAlchemy wraps it as `DataError` -- **not** `IntegrityError` --
and `apps/api/.../main.py` registers a handler for `DomainError` only. The result is an
unhandled 500 and, worse, a session left in a failed transaction, so every later statement
on it fails too.

Every previous instance was a column the caller wrote directly, and the sweep that found
them looked at exactly those. This one is the first on a *derived* column, which is why it
survived: `InvoiceLineIn.quantita` and `prezzo_unitario` correctly mirror
`Numeric(12, 6)`, and their **product** goes to `invoice_lines.prezzo_totale`,
`invoices.imponibile` and `invoices.totale`, all `Numeric(12, 2)`. No bound on the two
factors can express a bound on the product -- `100000 x 100000` is two perfectly valid
six-digit factors and an eleven-digit result -- so the check cannot live in Pydantic and
belongs in the service, before the flush.

There are two arithmetic routes to the overflow and both are tested here: one line whose own
product is too large, and two hundred lines that each fit while their sum does not.
`InvoiceCreate.righe` allows 200 lines, so the second needs no exotic input at all.
