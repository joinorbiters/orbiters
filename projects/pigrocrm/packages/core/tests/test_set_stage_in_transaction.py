"""The mutation half of a stage change, without the transaction or the timeline.

Four things it deliberately does **not** do, each of which is a test below: authorise,
record, commit, or reach the database on its own. It is called by `AutomationRunner`
inside `set_offer_state`'s transaction, where the authorisation has already happened
(`actor.require_write`) and the commit belongs to the trigger.

`_settle_probability` is reused rather than reimplemented, which is the only reason that
function is at module level: the invariant "won at 60% is unreachable" has to hold on this
path too, and an invariant reachable through two paths must live in one function.
