"""Which invoices are worth chasing -- and, first of all, which are not.

Four conditions, one test each, plus the signal the previous system could not have had. Each
condition is here because its absence is a message somebody's client receives: chasing a paid
invoice, chasing three days after the due date while the transfer is in flight, chasing twice in
one afternoon because the first one was forgotten, and chasing a disputed invoice forever.

The two conditions the brief's table could not name are in here too, and they are the
ones slice 3's real shape adds: a `bozza` has no number and no legal existence, and an
`annullata` invoice has been withdrawn. Sending a payment demand for either is not a
milder mistake than the four above -- it is the same mistake with a legal document
attached.
